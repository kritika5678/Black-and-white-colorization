# Black-and-white-colorization
This project uses OpenCV and a pre-trained deep learning model to colorize black and white images. It processes grayscale images through a CNN that predicts color information in the Lab color space, generating realistic and visually appealing colorized outputs. The system is efficient for image restoration and enhancement tasks.
